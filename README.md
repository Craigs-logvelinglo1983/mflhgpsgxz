Jus got ouut and wow, Dual is like... I dunno, getting lost in a corn maze when the clouds are low and you can't see squat except whisps of dry stalks whispering. So I sat on this bench, popcorn crumbles making a crunchy cushion under me (note to self: clean later). And damn, I still hear the swirling score in my ears like a swarm of bees debating life and death existential dilemmas.

> The theater was loud, ppl munching & some kid dropped his soda near my feet, sticky puddle moving slooowly towards me. The smell was kind of a mix of unreal butter and stale coke, which somehow fits the whole eerie vibe of Dual... it’s like the director bottled theater smells and smeared them onscreen. 😂 And the popcorn's still digging into my back, like the rock-hard metaphors in that fight scene. You know the one.

If I could 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   into my brain, I would... but maybe not? It felt like sprites fighting over the last byte of RAM. Or clones trying to out-feel one another with expressions so granular you could knit a sweater with them (the sweater would be itchy, but feel profound). Karen Gillan, she’s there twice like seeing yourself in a dirty funhouse mirror, reflections all wonky and questioning, is this how I really am, or how you see me? But you just wanna shout, Hey, it’s all cool! while you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   through syllables of munching.

Aching back's a signal, probably from the angle I twisted 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 the scene where dual-lives tangle like vines left unpruned all summer. Two lives interwining like err... can't think straight... knitting again?! Knitting for sure. And I kept thinking of those cloud-𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩ers with telescopes that ignore what's right in front (a thought with zero context).

𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , but then it's like you’re thinking, should I pinch myself now or later? Thoughts racing through me like a herd of cats with no common direction, screeching at shadows in the barn. 

// Here’s some nonsense that popped up:
def reality_check( , popcorn):
    if   == 'Dual':
        popcorn = 'existential'
    return popcorn  42
